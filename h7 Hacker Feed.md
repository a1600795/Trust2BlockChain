- Presenter was Charles Fol from France offensive security company called LEXFO

- After that they used a known method to overwrite a structure named SSL
- Then they could trigger SSL handshake
- The bug needed to be repeated multiple times
- After getting everything done he could use the exploitation and get login details in cleartext from the users who logged in to the VPN
- The next day four domain admins logged in
- Affected products are FortiOS 6.0.0 to 7.2.4 and FortiVPN 1.1.0 to 7.2.3
