A)

Elias presentation was good. I know the BEC frauds happen a lot. I've been working in a company that transferred money to a fraud bank account after a Finnish company operated from Spain send an email about a bank account change. The criminal used a look a like email address and pretended to be the CEO of the Finnish company. The amount wasn't that big. Also another my former workplace had a big line of fraud invoices, invoice fraud attack emails etc in the wall of their finance department as a reminder to be cautious.

It is difficult to say how companies could prevent these things from happening. It is like Elias said that the BEC criminals are very active and they try to identify possible targets to exploit constantly. So propably the most effective way to prevent this is the education of the staff. The finance needs more sophisticated training, but the training must cover all the employees, as the target can be anyone from the organization.
