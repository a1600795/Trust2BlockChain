Assignment h8 bonus. Reference: Karvinen, T. 2023. Trust to Blockchain 2023 autumn. Link: https://terokarvinen.com/2023/trust-to-blockchain/

# This h8 is completely voluntary. If you want to do this task, the deadline is the last class.

## If you update any tasks: Keep it true! Make it clear that practical tasks are actually done with a computer, include detail and screenshots. Make it clear how events progressed. When were the updates done? What was the order of the events?

### a) Updated: List and link tasks where you added substantial updates after cross review.

I updated to Tero's homepage as reference page for the assignment for the previous assignments where it was missing. But this was a separate task in assignment h4 public key. 

Other than that I didn't add anything afterwards as I believe it's kind of cheating. I completed some tasks on my own after I reviewed a classmate's work and saw how it was done properly, but I didn't update any of these activities to Github. So all the tasks I did are genuinely untouched after they were submitted to Laksu.

### b) Bonus: List and link voluntary bonus tasks you've completed.
