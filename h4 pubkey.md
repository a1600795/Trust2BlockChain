# h4 pubkey

### x) Read and summarize (with some bullet points)

### a) Pubkey today. Explain how you have used public key cryptography today or yesterday, outside of this homework. In addition to naming the system, identify how different parties use keys in different steps of the system. (Answering this question likely requries finding sources on your own. This subtask does not require tests with a computer.)

Public key cryptography is a common encryption method. For example Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure or HTTPS is used to secure data transfer between the web browser and website. The encryption protocol for HTTPS is Transport Layer Security (TLS) and it is based on asymmetric public key infrastructure. HTTPS websites have public keys that are available for visitors of the website. The public key encrypts all the data submitted on the website and sent to the web server. The web server has the private key which is used to decrypt received data. It is recommended to use websites only with HTTPS, especially if sensitive information such as credentials is required. HTTPS prevents sniffing and on-path attacks.
